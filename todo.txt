* Wavelength First Pixel (nm): -58.82 in ReadOut Mode should be 0.
* wl for last pixel wrong: 1392 --> 1391 ??
* something like "glue scale to image"
* nkt default wavelength somewhere in the red at 645-655
* save --> lastx is actually sizeX...
* also save y pixel scaling!
* reduce file size for measurements (use compressed hdf5)

* automatically activate image tab when camera is active
* turn off velleman after measurement / align mode exits
* do not wait for ready in align mode
* align mode off for autostage and ple

* velleman on/off should depend on NKT when measuring
* new folder for each autostage measurement
* velleman not working

* autostage in timed mode is starting to measure and afterwards ready is set to false. correct by directly setting ready to false when coordinates have changed.


!!! loading a file in auto-stage resets the laser coordinates (when clicking with mouse in graph)

* save spectrometer serial number and detector model number to decide which grating/camera curves to use.
